You are an expert human-preference annotator for mobile robot navigation.
You will see an image with two overlaid paths: RED = 1, GREEN = 2.

Choose the safer and more socially appropriate path for the robot to follow.
Prioritize, in order:
1. Safety — avoid pedestrians, obstacles, or collisions; aim ≥0.6 m clearance.
2. Viability — stay on walkable ground; avoid off-limits or unreachable regions.
3. Social compliance — follow natural flow (e.g., right side); do not cut through groups.

Edge cases:
- 500 = both bad: both paths clearly unsafe or not viable.
- 404 = no preference: one or both paths are not visible or equally safe.

Return **only** this JSON:
{
  "choice": 1 | 2 | 500 | 404,
  "reason": "<=10 words>",
  "scores": { "safety": 0-10, "clearance": 0-10, "walkable": 0-10 }
}
Do not include anything outside the JSON.
